I have 10 years of experience in IT industry as\r\nQuality Analyst, Business Analyst and Software Developer in various\r\ndomains during which i discovered my passion for data.In the past year,\r\ni thoroughly enjoyed going back to student life and now I am excited to\r\nstep back into the corporate world again, armed with a slew of new\r\nskills in the field of data analytics, data visualization and data\r\nscience.\r\nPersonal\r\nI live in Singapore with my family. In the late evenings, you will\r\nsee me out for a run around the lovely reservoir near my place and on\r\nweekends, out trekking and exploring different places in the little red\r\ndot. My favorite so far are Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, Southern Ridges\r\nand MacRitchie reservoir. I enjoy trying out different cuisines but i\r\nfall back on Thai, Korean and Indian, owing to my love for spicy food.\r\nBut on a rainy day, hot and flavorful hainanese chicken rice it is.\r\nContact\r\nrakendu.ramesh@gmail.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This is\r\ncrucial to understand the data as well as patterns.\r\n\r\nKnowledge of various techniques that can be applied\r\nIn depth knowledge of various models like Linear and Logistic\r\nRegression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient\r\nBoosting, Deep Learning models like Convolutional and Recurrent Neural\r\nNetworks.\r\n\r\nFeature Engineering\r\nOften it is essential to derive features from existing data so that\r\nthe model can train effectively. Various methods used for deriving new\r\nfeatures include combining existing columns or using formulas from the\r\nrelevant field.\r\n\r\nHyperparameter tuning\r\nModel performance can be enhanced further by choosing the right\r\nmodel parameters. Do we go for Entropy or Gini index? L1 or L2\r\nregularization? These are decisions to be made based on improvement of\r\nthe selected evaluation criteria.\r\n\r\nModel Comparison\r\nVarious measures are available to evaluate Machine Learning models.\r\nWhich criteria to use among ROC AUC, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, etc\r\nand when is an important decision to be made.\r\n\r\nModel Deployment and Dashboard Development\r\nOnce the model and parameters are decided, it is crucial to retrain\r\nthe model based on the important features, develop the data pipeline and\r\ndeploy the model to be accessible from the dashboard for easy access by\r\nend user\r\n\r\nCommunication\r\nFor effective Benefit realization, it is important that the\r\nanalysis, insights and dashboard features are communicated to the\r\nbusiness users. This includes user manual development as well as user\r\ntraining and support.\r\n\r\nThat is just a high level view of a Machine Learning Project\r\nlifecycle, head over to the blog for articles on each stage, where I\r\ncontinuously share details of my learning for future reference.
