I have 10 years of experience in IT industry as\r\nQuality Analyst, Business Analyst and Software Developer in various\r\ndomains during which i discovered my passion for data.In the past year,\r\ni thoroughly enjoyed going back to student life and now I am excited to\r\nstep back into the corporate world again, armed with a slew of new\r\nskills in the field of data analytics, data visualization and data\r\nscience.\r\nPersonal\r\nI live in Singapore with my family. In the late evenings, you will\r\nsee me out for a run around the lovely reservoir near my place and on\r\nweekends, out trekking and exploring different places in the little red\r\ndot. My favorite so far are Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, Southern Ridges\r\nand MacRitchie reservoir. I enjoy trying out different cuisines but i\r\nfall back on Thai, Korean and Indian, owing to my love for spicy food.\r\nBut on a rainy day, hot and flavorful hainanese chicken rice it is.\r\nContact\r\nrakendu.ramesh@gmail.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
